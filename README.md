# supersid

Sudden Ionospheric Disturbance detector from Stanford U. SuperSID project.

This project is based around Tom Hagen's SUPERSID amplifier circuit, a basic loop antenna, and a Raspberry Pi. 

## Synthesis

I am a very, very amateur astronomer with a love for radio astronomy that spans back to 1998 when I was a wee lad at Western Kentucky University.  While my background since then has been in mechanical engineering and manufacturing, I have always loved radio astronomy, the universe we float through, and learning as much as possible. 

This project is to keep me entertained, and really nothing else :smile:.

I came across the SuperSID project on the [SARA website](https://radio-astronomy.org/) and immediately fell in love with it because it gave me a chance to get my feet back into radio astronomy for as cheap as possible, and I could combine this with my newfound love of making and programing.

### SIDs and Space Weather

### How does it work?

### Data and Interpretation

### Goals
1. Have fun with radio astronomy
2. Learn how to build a functioning antenna and system from scratch
3. Get a working, usable systrem
4. Contribute what little I can to the scientific community
5. Learn about low frequency radio astronomy and it's applications

## Hardware
